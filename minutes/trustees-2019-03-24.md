The board signed off on the minutes from the last meeting.

### Issues arising

1. Sam has registered the charity's new address with the UK charity regulator.
1. Sam has updated the trustee list with Chelsey's updated term of service
1. Sam gave an update as to the fundraising process. JustGiving and Charities Trust accounts have been created allowing us to claim tax relief for individual personal donations via GiftAid, and pre-tax salary donations. In addition we are expecting payment of a number of invoices from companies who have sponsored hardware, apparel etc.
1. We spent some time discussing the colour scheme of this years tshirts and the importance of having the work done by a competent designer. Sam agreed to approach Jemimah on the same terms as last year for an estimate on the work required.
1. We discussed the need for Public Liability insurance for our American volunteers. Hiscox, our current insurance broker, is unwilling to extend PL cover to US residents and so Sam has volunteered to find an alternative provider.

### Charitable aims

The attendees agreed that they were continuing to fulfil all the aims of the registered charity.

### Other Business

None.
