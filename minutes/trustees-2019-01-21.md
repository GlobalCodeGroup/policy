   Chelsey Roebuck | Sunday, 16th July 2017 | 2 years

1. Sam proposed that the board agree to extend Chelsey's trusteeship by three years. James seconded and Chelsey accepted the nomination.
1. Sam gave an update as to the bank account progress and JustGiving progress which has caused some headaches but which should now be fixed
1. Now that we've got a JustGiving account set up, Sam agreed to create a "donate a flight to Ghana" button to encourage donations.
1. Sam gave an update on the East Africa trip. Other options were discussed including Tanzania, South Africa and Malawi. It's obvious that this will require more discussion in the coming months.
1. Sam gave an update as to his plans this year, which include working with 2018 alumni, finding class visit sites for the 2019 program, and working on volunteer recruitment, admin and timetabling.
