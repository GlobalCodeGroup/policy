Global Code takes volunteers to Ghana for three weeks every July, to teach students at Ghanaian universities how to be software engineers.

We are a charity registered in the UK, number 1176504

Ghana is a very safe country, the Global Code Summer Program is carefully planned, and we expect that nothing will go wrong.

Because we’re a small organisation, we’re exempt from some risk assessment formalities, however, due to the nature of the work and because we care about your safety, we’d like to highlight a few points:

1. Working hours
Our program runs for three weeks, every weekday, from 9am-12 midday, and from 1pm-4pm. The teaching work is intensive and so you will find that you’re tired by the end of the day. Make sure you get enough sleep.
2. Working environment
We work in labs in universities in Ghana. Whilst the lab spaces are relatively modern, it’s likely that they aren’t held to the rigorous standards we’re used to in the UK. You might see frayed or dangling cables, broken furniture, or uncovered holes in the floor. Stay vigilant and be careful.
3. Cabling
You might be responsible for setting up our hardware. The Raspberry Pi computers that we use are low-power, but make sure there are no dangling cables for people to trip over. If you’re using your own laptop, please make sure that it’s plugged in securely with no dangling cables.
4. Cars
Global Code asks host universities to provide transport to and from the airport, and for a class trip. If you take a private taxi into town, you’re on your own. Our insurance doesn’t cover vehicle accidents and the cars in Ghana are not held to anywhere near the standards you’d expect in the UK. Please be careful.
5. Streets and pavements
Road surfaces might be damaged or might not exist. Pavements are often simply concrete covers over drains, and are sometimes broken or cracked. The pedestrian right-of-way might not exist. Drivers may not be licensed. 
6. Weather
Ghana is a tropical country and so is exposed to extremes of climate. Prepare for both hot and wet weather. The weather can change dramatically and without warning, and paths and roads will become slippery. Please make sure you’re wearing appropriate footwear.
