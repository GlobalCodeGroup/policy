Global Code takes volunteers to Ghana for three weeks every July, to teach students at Ghanaian universities how to be software engineers.

We are a charity registered in the UK, number 1176504

In order to run the Summer Program we need to collect some personal information about you. The information is currently only available to Sam Moorhouse, and will only ever be available to the Global Code staff and relevant agents. For example, we need to pass along your passport details to a travel agent.

We collect your name, address, passport number, telephone number, and email address for planning and public relations purposes. We’ll keep this on file for three years unless you ask me to delete it sooner, in which case we will. Currently it’s stored in a document in Google Drive, and we have no control over Google’s retention policies. 

We’ll be taking photographs before during the program. We’ll make the photos available to media agencies and put them on our website. If you ask, we’ll take them off the website.

Ghana requires foreign nationals to have been vaccinated against Yellow Fever at least ten days before the date of travel, and so we’ll also need to know the details of your Yellow Fever vaccination.

We care deeply about your privacy and won’t pass on the information you give me to any third parties unless it’s necessary for the program to run, and we’ll let you know if that’s the case.
